# Weather Forecasting Project

This repository contains code for exploring and analyzing weather data from the Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily) data set. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models for predicting weather patterns and extreme weather events based on historical data.

## Data

The GHCN-Daily data set is available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and is stored in the `data/ghcn-daily/` directory. This directory contains scripts for cleaning and pre-processing the data, as well as notebooks for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.

## Models

Machine learning models for weather forecasting are stored in the `models/` directory. Currently, we have implemented linear regression and neural network models, but additional models may be added in the future.

## Visualizations

Scripts for creating visualizations of weather data are stored in the `visualizations/` directory. This includes temperature maps, precipitation charts, and other types of plots and graphs.

## Usage

To run this code, you will need to have Python 3.x installed, along with the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. To install the required packages, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the packages are installed, you can run the various scripts and notebooks in the repository. Refer to the README files in each subdirectory for more specific instructions.
